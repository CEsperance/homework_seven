# What is autoincrementing?
Auto_incrementing is a field generates a unique number for every new record added to a table. It is used for the primary key column and automatically generates a unique number

# Difference between creating a join and subquery
Joins combine rows from one or more tables based on a matched column between them. Subqueries have an outer query and one or more nested queries within the outer query, and can be  useful to select rows from a table with a condition that depends on the data in the same or another table. The subquery (nested query) is used to return data that will be used in the main query as a condition to further restrict the data to be retrieved. Joins can be more efficient than subqueries.
